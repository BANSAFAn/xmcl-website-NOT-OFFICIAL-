## üö´ Future Plans & Decisions
- **No Framework Switch**: The site will remain on Vite. Switching to Astro, Next, or Nuxt is not planned, as the current setup is deemed simple and convenient.
- **No Chat or Neural Network Features**: The site will not evolve into a chat platform or integrate complex AI features.
- **No Core Guide Tab**: Instead of a separate tab, core guides will be integrated into the `/Guide` section for easier searching and management.
- **Potential View Log Page**: A View Log page, inspired by [xmcl-log-viewer](https://github.com/Voxelum/xmcl-log-viewer), is under consideration. However, its implementation depends on server load concerns, and a simpler UI might be adopted.
