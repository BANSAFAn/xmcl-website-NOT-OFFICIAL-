## üö´ What We‚Äôre *Not* Doing (For Now)

To keep the project focused and secure, we‚Äôve decided **against** the following:

- **No migration to Astro.js** ‚Äì We‚Äôre sticking with our current stack.
- **No Discord webhooks** ‚Äì Due to permission and security concerns.
- **No site-wide search engine** ‚Äì It‚Äôs deemed unnecessary for our current scope.

## üì¨ New Content Added

We‚Äôve also published several new posts and documentation pages, including:

- `i18n-en`, `i18n-zh`, `i18n-uk`
- `Demo-Minecraft`
- `Date Storage` (by CIO10)
- Technical guides on `User`, `Data-Storage`, `Instance`, `Java`, and `Settings`
