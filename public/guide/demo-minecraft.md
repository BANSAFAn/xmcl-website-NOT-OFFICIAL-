# 🎮 How to Start Playing Minecraft Without a License (For Beginners)

If you've just downloaded Minecraft, launched it "as is," and saw this screen:

…you're probably wondering:

> ❓ **Why did this happen?**

The answer is simple: **you haven’t signed in to an account yet**. Without registration, Minecraft launches in **demo mode**, which is very limited in functionality.

## 🔑 What to Do Next?

1. Click on **"Manage Account"**:

2. If you’re not registered, you’ll see a screen prompting you to sign in or create a Microsoft account:

   You can:
   - Create a **free Microsoft account** through your browser.
   - Use **Device Code** — a convenient login method that doesn’t require typing your credentials on the device itself: just visit the link, enter the code, and confirm the sign-in.

> 💡 **What is Device Code?**  
> It’s an authentication method where, instead of entering your login details directly on the device, you go to a website (e.g., `microsoft.com/link`), enter the code shown on your screen, and confirm the login through an already-authenticated browser session.

## 🆓 What If I Don’t Own a Minecraft License?

No worries! The official Minecraft launcher includes a **Developer Mode** that unlocks alternative login methods — no purchase required.

### How to Enable Developer Mode:

1. Go to **Launcher Settings**.
2. Find the **"Developer Mode"** option and turn it on:

After enabling it, you’ll see additional login options:

- **Offline**
- **Littleskin**
- **Ely.by**

## 🧩 What Are These Systems?

### 🟢 **Offline Mode**
- The simplest option: you enter a username and play **locally**, without connecting to Mojang’s servers.
- Perfect for single-player worlds or local servers.
- Your username isn’t verified for uniqueness — you can pick any name you like.

### 🟡 **Littleskin**
- A free, community-driven account and skin service originally from China.
- Lets you use **custom skins** even without an official Minecraft license.
- Works with most launchers and many multiplayer servers (if they support third-party accounts).
- Website: [https://littleskin.cn](https://littleskin.cn)

### 🔵 **Ely.by**
- A popular Russian-language platform for unofficial Minecraft accounts.
- Supports custom skins, capes, session authentication, and works on many community servers.
- Widely used in the CIS region.
- Website: [https://ely.by](https://ely.by)

> ✅ **Recommendation:**  
> For beginners, **Offline** (for solo play) or **Littleskin** (for custom skins and more flexibility) are the best choices.

If you want to buy a license, it's best to buy it at minecraft.net so that you get proper support from Mojang and also so that you don't get ripped off.
