### Is XMCL Legal, Safe, and Free to Use?

Yes. We understand that using third-party software can raise questions, so let's be perfectly clear: **XMCL is a legitimate, safe, and free open-source launcher that respects both players and the game's creators.** It is **not** a "cracked" or illegal launcher and does not support piracy in any way.

Here's why you can trust XMCL:

*   **100% Legal: It Requires You to Own Minecraft.**
    XMCL is simply an alternative interface to launch the game. It **does not** bypass Minecraft's authentication. You are required to log in with a valid Microsoft or Mojang account that you have purchased. The launcher downloads all game files directly from Mojang's official servers, ensuring you get the authentic, unmodified game.

*   **Safe & Virus-Free: Verified by Open-Source Transparency.**
    The single biggest guarantee of safety is that XMCL is fully **open-source**. The entire source code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/voxelum/x-minecraft-launcher). This means anyone—from casual developers to security experts—can inspect every line of code to verify it does nothing malicious. You don't have to take our word for it; you can trust the transparency that the open-source community provides.

*   **Free as in "Freedom": Built for the Community.**
    XMCL is free software. This means it costs nothing to use and is developed by the community, for the community. Its goal is to provide a superior Minecraft experience with powerful features that aren't available in the official launcher.

### What Makes XMCL a Powerful Alternative?

XMCL is a modern, feature-rich launcher designed to give you more control over your Minecraft installations while saving you time and disk space.

**Key Features and Principles:**

*   **Open and Transparent Development:** As mentioned, the code is public on [GitHub](https://github.com/voxelum/x-minecraft-launcher). This is the foundation of our commitment to safety and community trust.
*   **Disk-Efficient Resource Management:** XMCL's unique system stores all your mods, resource packs, and shaders in a single library. It then uses "links" to add them to your different game instances, preventing duplicate files and saving a significant amount of disk space. No more copying the same mods into multiple folders!
*   **Comprehensive Installation Support:** Easily install vanilla Minecraft, Forge, Fabric, Quilt, and OptiFine. The launcher can even manage Java (JVM) installations for you.
*   **Powerful Multi-Instance Management:** Create and manage separate, isolated instances of Minecraft. This is perfect for keeping different versions, modpacks, and configurations completely separate and organized.
*   **Integrated Community Content:** Browse, download, and update mods and modpacks directly from CurseForge and Modrinth without leaving the launcher.
*   **Fast and Cross-Platform:** Built with modern technology, XMCL is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It also features optimized, parallel downloads to get you in the game faster.
*   **Customization and Connectivity:** Supports custom skin services (like Blessing Skin and ely.by) and includes a unique peer-to-peer feature to play multiplayer over a virtual LAN with friends anywhere.

**In summary, XMCL is a powerful, secure, and community-driven launcher that enhances your Minecraft experience while operating legally and transparently. It's a testament to what open-source development can offer: a robust, feature-rich, and trustworthy alternative for the global Minecraft community.**
