# License Not Work

If you purchased a license but it is not working in the launcher, please follow these steps:

1.  **Verify Account**: Ensure you are logged into the launcher with the same Microsoft/Mojang account that holds the license.
2.  **Check Internet Connection**: The launcher needs to verify the license with Mojang servers.
3.  **Re-login**: Try logging out and logging back in.
4.  **Microsoft Store**: Open the Microsoft Store and ensure your Minecraft Launcher is up to date (even if you use X Minecraft Launcher, it validates against your entitlement).

If issues persist, please contact support.
