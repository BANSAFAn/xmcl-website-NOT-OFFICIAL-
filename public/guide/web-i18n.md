# How to Add Your Own Translation

To add a new language to the XMCL website project:

1. **Create translation files:**
   - In `src/locales/`, create a new JSON file named after the language code (e.g., `fr.json` for French).
   - Copy the structure from `en.json` and translate all strings.
   - In `src/locale/`, create a new YAML file named after the language code (e.g., `fr.yaml`).
   - Copy the structure from `en.yaml` and translate all strings.

2. **Update configuration:**
   - Edit `src/i18n/languageConfigs.ts`.
   - Add a new entry to the `languageConfigs` array with the code, name, flag, and color gradient (e.g., { code: 'fr', name: 'FranÃ§ais', flag: 'ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·', color: 'from-blue-500 to-red-500' }).

3. **Test the translation:**
   - Run the development server (`npm run dev`).
   - Select the new language from the language selector.
   - Verify that all texts are correctly translated and displayed.

4. **Contribute your changes:**
   - Commit your changes to Git.
   - Create a pull request on the project's GitHub repository.
