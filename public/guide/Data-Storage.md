## Data Storage

XMCL data is divided into two parts:

1.  **XMCL's own cache and database**, generated by Chromium.
2.  **Minecraft-related data**.

### XMCL Cache and Database

The cache related to XMCL itself is stored in the system's `appdata` path, which varies depending on the operating system.

| Platform           | Data Path                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Windows**        | `%AppData%\xmcl`                                                          |
| **Windows (APPX/appinstaller)** | - Version < 0.34: `%LocalAppData%\Packages\XMCL_ncdvebj03zfcm\LocalCache\Roaming\xmcl` <br> - Version >= 0.34 and < 0.40: `%LocalAppData%\Packages\XMCL_68mcaawk44tpj\LocalCache\Roaming\xmcl` |
| **macOS**          | `~/Library/Application Support/xmcl`                                      |
| **Linux**          | `~/.config/xmcl`                                                          |

> **Note:**  
> Do not delete the files here unless you know what you are doing. This can lead to loss of launcher settings or data.

Within these paths, you will find several `json` files used to store various configurations, and the database will also be stored here.

- **[User data](../protocol/user.md)**: Stores user accounts, skin links, etc. Stored in the `/user.json` file.
- **[Global settings](../protocol/setting.md)**: Global settings, such as language, proxy URL, download node, etc. Stored in the `/settings.json` file.
- **[Instance cache](../protocol/instance.md)**: Records the last selected instance path and the paths of all known instances. Stored in the `/instances.json` file.
- **[Java cache](../protocol/java.md)**: Records detected Java paths, version information, etc. Stored in the `/java.json` file.
- **[Resource database](../protocol/resources.md)**: Metadata for resource files, such as parsed mod information. Stored in `leveldb` format, in the `/resources-v2` folder.
- **[Logs](../protocol/logs.md)**: XMCL historical logs. Stored in the `/logs` folder.

### Minecraft-related Data

You are likely familiar with the directory structure of Minecraft data.
XMCL's data directory is slightly different from Minecraft's:

```
"Public Data folder"
â””â”€ ðŸ“‚mods            # Shared mods folder for all instances
  â””â”€ modA.jar        # A specific mod file, instance might link mods from it.
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚resourcepacks   # Shared resourcepacks folder for all instances
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚shaderpacks    # Shared shaderpacks folder for all instances
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚versions       # Shared versions folder for all instances
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚assets         # Shared assets folder for all instances
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚libraries      # Shared libraries folder for all instances
â””â”€ ðŸ“‚instances      # Contains the instances created by XMCL
```

Most of the content is the same as Minecraft's, with the `instances` folder containing all instance files.
