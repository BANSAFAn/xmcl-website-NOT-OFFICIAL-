# Translation Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to add, update, and maintain translations for the XMCL website.

## Getting Started

All translation files are located in the `src/locales` directory. Each language has its own JSON file, named with the corresponding language code (e.g., `en.json` for English, `ru.json` for Russian).

The `en.json` file serves as the master template for all other translations. When adding new keys or making structural changes, always update `en.json` first.

## Adding a New Language

To add a new language to the website, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a new translation file:**
    *   In the `src/locales` directory, create a new JSON file with the appropriate language code (e.g., `es.json` for Spanish).
    *   Copy the entire content of `en.json` into your new file.

2.  **Translate the content:**
    *   Translate all the string values in your new language file.
    *   **Important:** Do not translate the keys.

    Example:

    ```json
    // en.json
    {
      "nav": {
        "home": "Home"
      }
    }

    // es.json
    {
      "nav": {
        "home": "Inicio"
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Update the language configuration:**
    *   Open the `src/i18n/languageConfigs.ts` file.
    *   Add a new entry to the `languageConfigs` array for the new language.

    Example:

    ```typescript
    // src/i18n/languageConfigs.ts
    export const languageConfigs = [
      // ... existing languages
      {
        code: 'es',
        name: 'EspaÃ±ol',
        flag: 'ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸',
        color: 'from-yellow-500 to-red-500',
      },
    ];
    ```

4.  **Test your changes:**
    *   Run the development server: `npm run dev`.
    *   Open the website in your browser and select the new language from the language switcher.
    *   Verify that all text is displayed correctly in the new language.

5.  **Submit your changes:**
    *   Commit your changes and create a pull request on the project's GitHub repository.

## Handling Missing Translations

If a translation key is missing from a language file, the website will fall back to the English translation for that key.

When new keys are added to `en.json`, they should be added to all other language files as well.

The following keys are currently missing and need to be translated:

*   `guide.readMore`
*   `testing.loading`

## Updating Existing Translations

To update an existing translation, simply edit the corresponding value in the language file.

## Best Practices

*   **Consistency:** Try to maintain a consistent tone and style across all translations.
*   **Clarity:** Use clear and concise language.
*   **Context:** Pay attention to the context in which the text will be displayed.
*   **Formatting:** Preserve any HTML tags or placeholders in the translated strings.
